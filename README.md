How this program works:

1. Gets the User's Input:
The program first asks for your name and favorite number.

2. Checks if the Number is Prime:
If your favorite number is a prime number, the program will tell you it’s prime.
If the number is not prime, the program will say it’s not a prime number.

3. Invalid Inputs:
If you enter something that’s not a number (like a word or symbol), the program will display a message saying it’s an invalid number and ask you to try again.
